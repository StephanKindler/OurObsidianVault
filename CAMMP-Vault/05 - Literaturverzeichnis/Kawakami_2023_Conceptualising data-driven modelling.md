>[!abstract]- Abstract 
>This study constructs and illustrates a framework for describing and analysing data-driven modelling in school mathematics from the perspectives of mathematical and statistical models. Based on the constructivist view of models and the perception that they are the subject’s deterministic or stochastic interpretation, the framework consists of the triplet of data/context, mathematical model, and statistical model, underpinning predictions. An existing research case is used to support the notion that the framework can serve as a tool for describing and analysing aspects of the transition and integration between mathematical and statistical modelling. In addition to being a research tool for linking mathematical modelling research and statistics education research, the framework can be a pedagogical tool for designing activities and teacher intervention in data-driven modelling.
